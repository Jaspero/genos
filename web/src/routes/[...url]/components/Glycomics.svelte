      <h2>Analyses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Released N-glycans</li>
      </ul>
      N-glycans are released from glycoproteins by digestion with PNGaseF, fluorescently labelled, purified and analysed by hydrophilic interaction ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HILIC-UHPLC-FLD) which allows relative quantification of different glycan species. Assignment of N-glycan structures is based on HILIC retention time, accurate mass and fragmentation spectra obtained by coupling HILIC-UHPLC-FLD to mass spectrometry via electrospray ionization (ESI-MS/MS).
      <ul>
        <li>Site-specific glycosylation</li>
      </ul>
      N-glycopeptides are obtained from glycoproteins by protease digestion, purified and analysed by C18 liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry via electrospray ionization (C18-LC-ESI-MS/MS). Relative quantification of N-glycopeptides in obtained in a site-specific manner determined by the amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein. Assignment of N-glycopeptide structures is based on accurate mass and fragmentation spectra.
      <ul>
        <li>Glycosylation site occupancy</li>
      </ul>
      Site occupancy analysis is used to calculate the occupancy of potential N-glycosylation sites by measuring the proportion of N-glycosylated peptides in total peptides. The analysis is performed by releasing N-glycans with PNGaseF in the presence of 18O water followed by protease digestion, purification and C18-LC-ESI-MS/MS.
