        description: 'Glycosylation is a post-translational modification process that involves the addition of sugar molecules to proteins. In the immune system, glycosylation plays an essential role in regulating the interactions between immune cells and their environment. In the case of antibodies, glycosylation at the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) region affects the antigen-binding affinity of antibodies and may lead to the development and progression of autoimmune diseases. The ERC-funded GlycanSwitch project aims to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying Fab glycosylation and its effects on the immune system. Researchers will focus on the glycosylation of the B cell receptor and its role in the selection and activation of autoreactive B cells. Project findings will provide the groundwork for targeted therapies against autoimmunity',

The EU-funded geneTIGA is developing a safe and efficient cell therapy based on genome-edited T cells to sustainably combat IgA nephropathy (IgAN), one of the most common causes of endstage renal disease. As an IgA disease, this cell therapy approach can form the blueprint for other IgA diseases including IgA myeloma, IgA related coeliac disease and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as other Ig diseases. Thus, geneTIGA researchers anticipate the delivery of a ‘living drug’ to treat IgAN and other IgA-associated diseases for entry to first-in-human clinical trials.',

        description: 'Biologics comprise a $511B market of advanced therapeutics that are used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases and beyond. Two thirds of biologics are decorated with sugar molecules attached to the therapeutics, including all antibody therapeutics, called monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). These sugar molecules are known as N-glycans and are vitally important for therapeutic safety and efficacy. To date, the N-glycans are poorly controlled and, as such, display highly heterogeneous patterns on a therapeutic. This complicates large-scale production and regulatory approval of biologics, and significantly limits the possibility of using N-glycans in therapeutic design. GlycoBoost revolutionises mAb design by delivering consistent N-glycans, precisely profiled with advanced analytical techniques. This innovation unlocks the full potential of N-glycans to elevate the effectiveness of mAbs. <br><br>Kyron.bio’s breakthrough technology uses cell engineering to produce therapeutic proteins with uniform and precision-controlled N-glycan patterns. This technology is being used to produce glycoengineered mAbs that are safer and more effective for patients, starting with mAbs used to treat autoimmune diseases where patient resistance to current treatments remains high. <br><br> Through a well-established collaboration between kyron.bio and Genos, one of the world leaders in glycoanalytics on whose SYSCID project this proposal is built, GlycoBoost aims to advance the project to commercialisation through the development of advanced glycoanalytical techniques, preclinical evaluation, pre-industrialisation, bespoke customer PoC’s, partnership-building, and fundraising. GlycoBoost will place Europe at the heart of the glycobiology revolution, leading to the development of safer and more effective treatments for autoimmune diseases and ultimately redefining the landscape of therapeutic drug development.',

Specializing in high-throughput glycomics, Genos has contributed glycomic data to over 200,000 samples from population, epidemiological, and clinical studies. With a focus on biomarker discovery and commercialization, Genos brings valuable expertise to the GLUCOTYPES Consortium. Previous research at Genos has shown that glycan biomarkers can predict the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) independently of traditional risk factors, offering complementary insights. Genos demonstrated that individual differences in plasma protein Nglycome composition can predict T2D up to 10 years before onset with gradual changes in the N-glycome becoming evident years before clinical signs of insulin resistance or T2D appear. <br><br>By analyzing total serum/plasma N-glycans in 11,000 samples available through the GLUCOTYPES project using advanced technologies, Genos will actively support the project\'s goal of developing personalized dietary strategies to address food-related health conditions (FrHCs) and non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs). The integration of Genos will follow the project\'s existing structure, with dedicated subtasks across several work packages, ensuring smooth incorporation of high-throughput glycomics analysis.

Glycans play essential roles in infectious disease biology, such as mediating host-pathogen interactions, contributing to immune effector functions, and regulating host immune responses. <br><br>Despite the importance of glycosylation in immunity, WORMVACS2.0 currently lacks an in-depth glycosylation analysis of the host’s immune system components - a highly relevant yet underexplored aspect of immunity against helminths that needs to be addressed in support of the development of effective anti-helminth vaccines.<br><br>To address this gap, GENOS, a global leader in high-throughput glycomics, will join the WORMVACS2.0 consortium to perform comprehensive glycosylation analyses on samples from controlled human helminth infection trials, natural infection cohorts, and animal vaccination models.

About 70% of all adults experience this problem at some point in their lives, and both conditions are among the top ten in terms of overall disease burden expressed as disability adjusted life years. Moreover, low back pain is the leading cause work absence in Europe, and it causes an enormous burden on individuals, industry and governments. Most patients (≥85%) seen in primary care with neck or low back problems have non-specific pain i.e., pain that cannot reliably be attributed to a specific disease or pathology. Many patients are therefore left with relatively few treatment options to effectively manage it.<br><br>Current European treatment guidelines recommend a package of care, which includes many different interventions shown to be small to moderately effective, such as self-management education, pain relief, encouragement of physical activity and return to work, a supervised exercise programme and manual therapies. A key aspect to consider is that patients with neck and low back pain are a heterogeneous group where the prognosis and precise mix of factors involved, varies substantially between individuals. This means that a one-size fits-all approach is not recommended, but methods to tailor treatment to the needs of the individual are still relatively under-developed. The Back-UP Project works for a better, personalised, faster and evidence-based management of neck and low back pain, through the development of a technological platform with prognostic models, addressed to patients, clinicians and occupational managers, based on the digital representation of multidimensional clinical information, and in-silico assessments of possible interventions.',

However, we are confident that by successfully combining complementary expertise in the (i) production of specialised monolithic chromatographic tools for high-throughput fractionation of complex biological fluids (BIA-SEP), (ii) purification of proteins from body fluids and membrane proteins (UNI-RI), (iii) high-throughput glycomic analysis by use of chromatography (Genos) and multiplexed capillary gel electrophoresis (MPI) and (iv) expertise in the field of viral immunology (MEDRI) we can achieve significant progress in this direction. All our partners are recognized leaders who already made significant progress beyond the state of the art in their respective fields.

Based on their genetic predispositions, and in consultation with specialists, a personalized exercise plan will be created to reduce the likelihood of sports injuries and the consequences of long-term rehabilitation and absence from the sports field, which is especially important for professional athletes.<br><br>Ligament and tendon injuries in recreational athletes often mean a complete cessation of recreational sports, which increases the likelihood of adopting an unhealthy lifestyle, weight gain, and potential development of cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. To make the product more accessible to a wider population and not just professional athletes, a sample collection kit is also planned, which can be ordered by mail or purchased at pharmacies.',
